h1. Dispenser : A php dependency injection library

h2. Intro

What I missed with most php dependency injection libaries was auto-completion
hence I took the long route and made my own which can export DI wiring to native php code.
Set the build in a ant task and it's easypeasy. 

h2. Progress

So far the basic stuff work. Theres various importers and exporters. More features are in the works.
I have yet to use it in a real project, but I plan to near future. When I do I will get a better feeling
of what is lacking. Feel free to give feedback. 

You can define/import wiring via:

* Programatically

* Array

* XML

* Yadif array
	
You can export to:

* Array

* Native php code 	
	
h2. Examples

There are various examples in the examples.php file, it's rough and ugly.
I am in the works of making a proper example documentation, and will be out soon.

h2. Tests

I have tried to be a good boy on writing tests, there's decent coverage. I still lack
tests on some of the newer features, importers/exporters.
