Still very early in development, has not been used in any real project. 

Main reason for making the 100th implementation of DI for php is that I lacked the ability to build the DI into raw php code that could be used in IDEs with autocompletion etc. The exporter is still not usable, but goal is to be able to setup a ant task to build it each time you change the DI wiring. 

I also plan to make a standalone import lib for Dispenser, so you can easily migrate from the larger existing DI libs out there for testing purposes. 

There are some very rough examples in the index.php file. 

I am also way behind on the tests, will sort it as soon as I am done with the exporter.
